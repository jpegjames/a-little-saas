# Breaking the Rules: Using SQLite to Demo Web Apps
This is a sample Ruby on Rail app showcasing a technique to provide a sandboxed demo environment allowing users to test your app written for a [Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/using-sqlite-demo-web-apps/). The article and app utilize SQLite to provide a demo environment for your Software as a Service (SaaS). 

### Branches
There are two branches: the `master` branch contains the finished code from the article. You can download it and test it right away. The `without-demo-env` branch does not have the code from the article and you can use this branch to try out the code for yourself. 

## Dependencies
This sample app is running on Ruby on Rails version 5.1.4 and Ruby version 2.4.1. However, the same technique should work with Rails version 3+, as well as older versions of Ruby. 

## Password
You do not necessarily need the admin user credentials for the included SQLite file, but just in case it is:
```
user: admin
pass: a-little-saas
```
